🧱 Level 1 — First Indochina War (1946–1954)
After the August Revolution, French colonists returned to invade Vietnam. Despite limited resources, our forces innovatively created an air defense system using infantry guns, heavy machine guns, and 37mm anti-aircraft artillery.
The Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 was the pinnacle: 37mm anti-aircraft guns shot down dozens of Dakota transport planes, contributing decisively to the historic victory.
👉 Mission: Use the 37mm anti-aircraft gun to protect the battlefield from enemy aircraft.


🔥 Level 2 — Early Vietnam War (1965–1968)
The US deployed troops directly to South Vietnam and expanded the war to North Vietnam. Modern aircraft like F-105s and F-4 Phantoms continuously conducted bombing raids.
Vietnamese air defense was upgraded with 100mm anti-aircraft guns, coordinating with radar and militia forces.
👉 Mission: Use anti-aircraft artillery to prevent bombing raids and protect the homeland.


✈️ Level 3 — MiG-21 Air Combat (1969–1972)
The Vietnam People''s Air Force officially entered the air combat phase. Young pilots flying MiG-21s directly engaged US fighters in the skies.
Air battles became contests of skill and strategy between pilots from both sides.
👉 Mission: Control the MiG-21 to destroy enemy aircraft in intense dogfights.


🚀 Level 4 — "Hanoi''s Dien Bien Phu in the Air" (1972)
The US launched Operation Linebacker II, deploying hundreds of B-52 bombers to bomb Hanoi. This was the fiercest battle, where SAM-2 missiles and anti-aircraft artillery coordinated closely to protect the capital.
In 12 days and nights, our forces shot down 81 US aircraft, including 34 B-52s — an unprecedented achievement.
👉 Mission: Control SAM-2 missiles to shoot down B-52s and protect Hanoi from aerial devastation.'
